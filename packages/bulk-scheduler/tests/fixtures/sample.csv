"Several key factors impact what you’ll pay for roof repair: the size of the damaged area, the roofing material, how steep your roof is, and whether there’s hidden water damage underneath.\n\nAn in‑person inspection is the only way to see what’s really going on, especially after storms.\n\nFor a detailed, no‑surprise estimate, call Roofing Mendoza at 910‑367‑7628. #RoofRepairCost #WilmingtonRoof #ProfessionalEstimate","2026-01-13T15:00:00Z",
"Homeowners often wonder if they should repair or replace their roof. If your roof is under 15–20 years old and the damage is limited to a small area, a focused repair is usually the most cost‑effective choice.\n\nIf you’re dealing with leaks in several areas, missing shingles across large sections, or repeated repairs, it may be more economical to consider a replacement.\n\nNot sure which option fits your home?
